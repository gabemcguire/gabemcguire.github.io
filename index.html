            <p class="text-lg mb-4">My name is Gabe McGuire.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-center">I work for the Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget as a part-time developer. Additionally, I am a computer science student at Michigan State University. <br><br> In my free time, I love to tinker and work on various projects. My primary focus as of late is on full-stack development. However, I am fond of all types of development, including frontend, backend, mobile, and game development.</p>
