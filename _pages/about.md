My name is Gabe McGuire. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Michigan State University. Alongside my academic journey, I am also employed as a part-time developer for the State of Michigan's Department of Technology, Management, and Budget (DTMB).

## ** My Journey **

My passion for technology and development began early, and over the years, I have honed my skills and expanded my knowledge base to include a diverse range of technologies and methodologies. 

## **Preferred Technologies**

I enjoy working with the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Front-end:** Vue 3, React, Tailwind CSS 
- **Back-end:** Django 
- **Tools and Platforms:** Azure Functions, Digital Ocean Droplets, Vercel 
- **Other:** Bayesian probabilistic programming, photogrammetry

## **Projects and Experience**

### **FortunaMetrics**

I am the sole developer of FortunaMetrics, a stock trading journal aimed at providing unprecedented insights and analytics. 

- Customizable trading metrics
- Ability to view metrics over custom time ranges
- High precision handling of fractional shares

### **Postman Alternative** 

Another project I am working on is a Postman Alternative using Rust and Tauri for the GUI, with Vue for the front end. This project aims to provide a robust history panel for requests, support for multiple body formats, and prettified JSON responses.

### **ArcGIS Automation**

In my role at DTMB, I have worked extensively with ArcGIS Arcade expressions to create reusable notification configurations. I am also focused on improving the usability and efficiency of ArcGIS by setting up scheduled evaluations for batch attribute rules.

## **Aspirations**

My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to develop innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and user experience. I aspire to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web and software development, and to contribute to meaningful projects that have a real-world impact.

## **Personal Interests**

Outside of my professional and academic life, I enjoy making music, playing games and programming of course.
