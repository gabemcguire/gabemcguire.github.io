# About Me

My name is Gabe McGuire. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Michigan State University. Alongside my academic journey, I am also employed as a part-time developer for the State of Michigan's Department of Technology, Management, and Budget (DTMB).

## My Journey

My passion for technology and development began early, and over the years, I have honed my skills and expanded my knowledge base to include a diverse range of technologies and methodologies. 

## Preferred Technologies

I enjoy working with the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Front-end:** Vue 3, React, Tailwind CSS, PrimeVue
- **Back-end:** Django, Rust, Tauri
- **State Management:** Pinia
- **Tools and Platforms:** ArcGIS, Notion, Plane, Postman
- **Other:** Bayesian probabilistic programming, photogrammetry

## Projects and Experience

### FortunaMetrics

I am the sole developer of FortunaMetrics, a stock trading journal aimed at providing a much better UI and being more affordable than existing solutions like TraderVue. The website features a dark theme and is built using Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, and Django. Key features include:

- Customizable trading metrics
- Ability to view metrics over custom time ranges
- High precision handling of fractional shares

### Postman Clone

Another project I am working on is a Postman clone using Rust and Tauri for the GUI, with Vue for the front end. This project aims to provide a robust history panel for requests, support for multiple body formats, and prettified JSON responses.

### ArcGIS Automation

In my role at DTMB, I have worked extensively with ArcGIS Arcade expressions to create reusable notification configurations. I am also focused on improving the usability and efficiency of ArcGIS by setting up scheduled evaluations for batch attribute rules.

## Academic Focus

In addition to my professional projects, I am deeply invested in academic research. My dissertation explores the impact of photogrammetry in anatomical education and student perception within the Community of Inquiry framework. This quantitative study utilizes a crossover design to assess the efficacy of photogrammetry compared to traditional anatomical images.

## Aspirations

My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to develop innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and user experience. I aspire to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web and software development, and to contribute to meaningful projects that have a real-world impact.

## Personal Interests

Outside of my professional and academic life, I am an avid trader, focusing on NVDA options. I also enjoy spending quality time with my son, who is 12 years old, 5'3", and 113 lbs with a mesomorphic build and great coordination. Balancing my work, studies, and family life is essential to me, and I strive to excel in all areas.
